Thus, you may not have a choice to prevent advertisements from being presented when using the Application; however, you do have choices to limit personalized advertisements that are tailored to your interests from FlexStrive.\n\nIf FlexStrive delivers personalized advertising in the Application, FlexStrive will provide notice and information about how you may be able to opt-out of such personalized advertisements.\_ Such opportunity to opt out may occur through your device settings (See \"Information and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile devices\" below).\_\n\nFlexStrive may also use other third party advertising networks to serve ads in the App. If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising that is delivered by third parties, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out programs that are administered by third parties, including the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EIDAA). Where applicable, you may exercise your opt-out choices at the [NAI website](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), the [DAA website](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/), or the [EIAA website](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). FlexStrive does not control these third-party provided opt-out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.\n\n**Information and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile devices**\n\nAs of the effective date of this policy, Apple and Google offered the owners of devices that use their operating systems, iOS and Android, options for limiting tracking and targeting in relation to ads. FlexStrive does not control your device level opt out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make through such mechanism or for the continued availability, accuracy, effectiveness, or location of that mechanism. Using a device level opt-out mechanism may opt you out of all third party personalized advertisements, not just those delivered by FlexStrive.\n\nIf you use an Apple device go [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/ht4228).\_\n\nIf you use an Android device, navigate to the google settings page, select ads and then choose to reset your Android Ad ID or opt-out of personalized ads.\n\nTo learn about options for many mobile ad networks, go [here](https://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device/).\n\n**California Online Privacy Protection Act notice**\n\nSharing with third parties for direct marketing purposes: California residents have the right to request the identity of any third parties to whom the resident's personal information was shared, if such sharing was to enable the third party's direct marketing efforts. If you are a California resident and wish to make such a request, please submit your request to contact@flexistrive.com OR to opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please email us at contact@flexistrive.com.\_\n\nHow we respond to \"Do Not Track\" signals: We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected in connection with the App for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide information in this App Privacy Policy about how to prevent the delivery of targeted ads. We do not, however, recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions. To learn more about Do Not Track signals, you can visit [allaboutdnt.com](https://www.allaboutdnt.com/).\n\n**Our policies concerning children**\n\nThe App is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. Children under 13 are authorized to use the App. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from a child under 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove that information from our records.\n\n**International operations and cross-border data transfer.**\n\nYour information may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries. If you don't live in the United States, FlexStrive SRL will control your personal data.\n\nWe store data about users on servers located in the United States and the EEA, and we may also store this information on servers and equipment in other countries. Personal data collected within Switzerland and the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of Switzerland and the EEA. The data we hold may also be processed by employees operating outside of Switzerland and the EEA who work for us or one of our affiliates or for one of our vendors. When we transfer your personal information internationally we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely, lawfully and in the manner we describe here. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your information is transferred to or stored, used or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.\n\nYour use of the Apps may involve the transfer, storage and processing of your information to and in various countries around the world where our servers are located and our databases are operated that may have different levels of privacy protection than your country. By using the App, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in our App Privacy Policy.\n\n**How long we keep your information**\n\nHow long we retain your information depends on why we collected it and how we use it. We will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements. For instance, we may retain some information for a few years after you have closed your account with us if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend or establish legal rights.\n\n**Security of your information**\n\nWe implement security measures to help protect the security of your information both online and offline. We take steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures vary based upon the sensitivity of your information.\n\nWhile we take precautions against possible security breaches of customer databases and records, no application, website, computer system or Internet transmission is completely secure. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information while it is being transmitted to our Service. Any transmission is at your own risk.\n\n**Changes to Application Privacy Policy**\n\nIf we decide to make material changes to the Application Privacy Policy, we will tell you and other App users by placing a notice on the App webpage or its equivalent in-game, or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you prior to the change becoming effective. We may supplement this process by placing notices on game blogs, social network pages, and/or forums and on other FlexStrive websites. You should periodically check our websites and this privacy page for updates.\n\n**Contact us**\n\nIf you have any questions, comments or concerns regarding the App Privacy Policy and/or practices, please send an e-mail to contact@flexistrive.com. All other inquiries should be directed to FlexStrive's Support Page.\n\n**INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DMCA TAKEDOWN POLICY**\n\n**Last Updated: May 20, 2024**\n\nFlexStrive respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same.\n\nIt is FlexStrive's policy, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, to disable and/or terminate the account or access of users who repeatedly infringe or are repeatedly charged with infringing the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others.\n\nIn accordance with the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998](https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf), FlexStrive will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement committed using the FlexStrive mobile apps and games (the \"App\") or websites (the \"Site\") and to claims of copyright or trademark infringement allegedly committed on FlexStrive's websites, apps, and other properties (\"FlexStrive Properties\") that are reported to FlexStrive as provided for in this policy.\n\n**Requirements for Notice of Alleged Infringement**\n\nPlease consult your legal counsel or see Section 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to confirm these requirements:\n\n*   Identify the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed, or - if multiple copyrighted works are covered by this Notice - you may provide a representative list of the copyrighted works that you claim have been infringed.\n*   Identify the material that you claim is infringing (or to be the subject of infringing activity) and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and provide information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material.
